Question:-
create table spending 
(
user_id int,
spend_date date,
platform varchar(10),
amount int
);

insert into spending values(1,'2019-07-01','mobile',100),(1,'2019-07-01','desktop',100),(2,'2019-07-01','mobile',100)
,(2,'2019-07-02','mobile',100),(3,'2019-07-01','desktop',100),(3,'2019-07-02','desktop',100);


/* User purchase platform.
-- The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop 
and a mobile application.
-- Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only 
and both mobile and desktop together for each date.
*/

Solution:-
with cte as(
select user_id ,spend_date, sum(amount)as amount, count(case when platform='desktop' then 1  end) as desktop_spending, 
count(case when platform='mobile' then 1  end) as mobile_spending,
count(distinct user_id) as total_count  from spending group by user_id,spend_date),

cte2 as(
 select *,
 case when desktop_spending =1  and mobile_spending =1
 then 'both' 
 when mobile_spending=1
 then 'mobile'
 when desktop_spending=1
 then 'desktop'
 end as status
 from cte 
 order by spend_date,amount),
 
cte3 as( 
 select spend_date,amount,status,total_count
 from cte2),

 cte4 as
(select spend_date from cte3 where status='both'),

cte5 as(
select distinct(c.spend_date) from spending c where c.spend_date not in( select s.spend_date from cte4 s))

select spend_date,status,amount,total_count
from cte3
union all
select spend_date, 'both' as status,0 as amount, 0 as 'total_count' from cte5

Aprroach 2:-
with cte as(select t1.*,t2.user_id as u2,t2.spend_date s2,t2.platform p2,t2.amount as a2
            from spending t1 left join spending t2
 on t1.user_id=t2.user_id and t1.spend_date=t2.spend_date and 
 t1.platform!=t2.platform),
cte2 as(
 select *,
 case when p2 is not null then 'both' else platform end as flag
 from cte)
 select spend_date,flag,sum(amount)as total_spent,count(distinct user_id) total_user from cte2
 group by spend_date,flag
  
 

Output:-
spend_date	status	amount	total_count
2019-07-01	mobile	100	      1
2019-07-01	desktop	100     	1
2019-07-01	both	   200	     1
2019-07-02	mobile	 100	     1
2019-07-02	desktop	100	     1
2019-07-02	both	   0	       0
