 Ques:- write an sql query to find winner in each group
--> The Winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group In the case of a tie,
--> the lowest player_id wins
   
create table players
(player_id int,
group_id int)

insert into players values (15,1);
insert into players values (25,1);
insert into players values (30,1);
insert into players values (45,1);
insert into players values (10,2);
insert into players values (35,2);
insert into players values (50,2);
insert into players values (20,3);
insert into players values (40,3);

create table matches
(
match_id int,
first_player int,
second_player int,
first_score int,
second_score int)
  
insert into matches values (1,15,45,3,0);
insert into matches values (2,30,25,1,2);
insert into matches values (3,30,15,2,0);
insert into matches values (4,40,20,5,2);
insert into matches values (5,35,50,1,1);

Sol:-
with cte as( select first_player as player_id,first_score as score from matches m1 
union  all  
select  second_player as player_id,second_score as score from matches m2),
cte2 as(
select player_id,sum(score) as score from cte 
group by player_id
),
cte3 as(
select p1.player_id, score,group_id from cte2 c 
join players p1
on p1.player_id=c.player_id
group by group_id,p1.player_id),
cte4 as(
select * ,
rank() over (partition by group_id order by score desc,player_id ) as rnk
from cte3)
select player_id,score, group_id
from cte4 where rnk=1

  
output:
player_id score group_id
15         3	   1
35	       1	   2
40	       5	   3
